  , "faqContent_Wat_kan_ik_met_MyContexts_doen": "With MyContexts you can safely create contexts in which you can share data with others for work, home, fun activities, and much more. You can choose free Apps from the MyContexts App Stores. This way, you determine the type of contexts you want to use and with whom you want to share those contexts."
  , "faqContent_Hoe_werkt_MyContexts": "MyContexts Apps are created in a special way. MyContexts includes a language that defines an application in terms of Contexts, Roles, and Perspectives (User roles have Perspectives on other User roles and Thing roles). Based on this, we calculate which users in a Context should receive which data to play their role in a Context. We then send that data to the devices of those users. As mentioned, no servers store your data. So, not via a Server."
  , "faqContent_Waarom_is_MyContext_veilig": "MyContexts works without servers. Servers can be hacked, exposing your data. Servers of companies that misuse your data and profit from it. No Server, no privacy issues."
  , "faqContent_Waarom_is_MyContexts_duurzaam": "No servers mean no Data Centers that consume energy and pollute the landscape."
  , "faqContent_Wat_is_het_verschil_met_bijvoorbeeld_WhatsApp": "To begin with, MyContext is not an App, but a language and a platform. In WhatsApp, it's all about Chats. Every Context in MyContexts has a standard Chat but also data and other Contexts you can navigate to. We call this the Who-What-Where setup. Who is participating in a Context?, What data is available in the Context to collaborate on, and Where can you go. We also think that WWW will soon stand for Who What Where :-)"
  , "faqContent_Waarom_kost_MyConexts_zo_weinig": "Because we don't have a central server and you only use your own devices to store and process data, we incur almost no costs. Therefore, 2 Euros per month or ten Euros per year is sufficient."
  , "faqContent_Stel_mijn_smartphone_gaat_kapot_Ben_ik_dan_alles_kwijt": "No, we have designed multiple mechanisms to restore your data even if your smartphone no longer works. Multiple Contexts serve as a backup for your data. Enter a code on the MyContexts website, a code you receive from us when you join, and we will restore your data on another device."
  , "faqContent_Werkt_MyContexts_ook_op_mijn_andere_apparaten": "Yes, you can use as many devices with MyContexts as you want. We ensure that your data and apps are synced between your devices."
  , "faqContent_Kan_ik_ook_zelf_MyContexts_Apps_maken": "For now, we create the Apps, but soon we will publish the language and tools to do this yourself. You will see that creating Apps for MyContexts is very simple."
  , "faqContent_Wie_heeft_MyContexts_gemaakt": "MyContext is the result of more than seven years of hard work by Joop Ringelberg and Cor Baars. Both Cognitive Scientists and experienced IT professionals."
  , "faqContent_Waarom_is_dit_nooit_eerder_gedaan": "You understand that companies that lure you to their servers to make money from it do not find this a good idea and do not invest in it. Furthermore, despite the simplicity of the idea, it is very complex to create. We have worked on it for more than seven years for a reason."
