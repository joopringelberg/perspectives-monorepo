# 3.0.0 (2025-06-20)


## Major Changes

This release represents a significant milestone for the Perspectives project:

* Completely new GUI, based on 'who' (plays a role in this context), 'what' (is it about) and 'where' (can you navigate from it to).
* All code is now in a monorepo structure
* Client side code is now in typescript
* Unified versioning across all packages
* Complete integration of incremental changes
* Improved module resolution and dependency handling
* Major architectural improvements for better performance and maintainability

This release is estimated to be at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7, meaning it is a fully functional prototype that can be tested in a relevant environment. It is ready for further testing and validation in real-world scenarios.
