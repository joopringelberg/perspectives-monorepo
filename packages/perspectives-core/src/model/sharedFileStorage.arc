                      Media files are too large to be sent directly to your peers. Consequently, MyContexts puts them in a place that you have write rights to, and from which your peers can read.

                      As MyContexts is totally distributed, we cannot provide you with a central place to put the media files that all MyContexts users want to share. 
                      However, you can easily set up your own storage. Currently we support the cloud service Mega. The company offers you a free account with 20Gb of storage. 
                      Sign up at the [Mega website](https://mega.nz/). Write down your username and password and enter them below. Write "mega" in the field 'StorageType' and you are all set. 
                      Rest assured: these credentials will never leave your computer (except to authenticate with Mega)! Such is the inherent safety of a truly distributed program such as MyContexts.

                      This is the actual shared file server that your installation uses to upload files. 
                      By default, it will be a location provided by the Perspectives project.
                      You can use it to upload a limited number of files to get you started.
                      When you exceed that limit, a warning will be shown.
